Hi Max,
We would like to express our thumb-up to Formlabs 2 fantastic performance, although we hope you can increase your production rate and accelerate the China order supply.

We has met your company¡¯s new Asia and pacific sales manager, Mr. Scott recently, now We would like to discuss some problem with you through a deep communication.

1.	Problem about setting up new agents in China

We had a simple communication during Mr. Scott¡¯s visit. First I appreciated that he could tell us about his project schedule. About new agents in China, I just want to express my personal opinion to you:  I do not object against increasing the number of China agents at appropriate time point, you can be sure of it since I have expressed to you clearly when you visited Xi¡¯an in 2014; At the present developing stage of Formlabs in China, I believe the sales number could not increase simply by increasing the number of new agents, increasing agents should be an project which could be kicked off after the a system framework established. Simply speaking, given that you had decided to set up a specific China office, which means you have owned a full-time staff in charge of the China mainland market operation, it would be a wise choice to add agents.Since in a complicate and broad market like china mainland, It is absolutely impossible to take control the market well and obtain a very remarkable sales number simply by telephones from an area manager in USA, e-mails remote communicate or visiting the agents in a scratching-the-surface way. Makerbot¡¯s China strategy has illustrated this viewpoint: in the past few year, no staffs from makerbot ever planed the market strategy in China and manage their 3 agents in China, instead of that, they just supply machines to their primary agents, as a result, their market in China is totally out of control, no one is willing to promote and popularize their brand, their price system is totally collapsed, their market share has shrunk by nearly 60~70%.Up to now, the total order per year number from these three agency is even smaller than that of only one agent in the past. Even though they have employed a full-time China Makerbot mainland manager who was selected from Stratesys, Shanghai organization, it will be difficult for them to handle such a complex and chaotic crisis. Very regretful.
	   We Elite Robotics has won 3 times Markerbot¡¯s best seller awards of APJ area in the past 4 years, the achievement is the best certification, so for Formlabs, we have the sufficient ability to get an ¡±excellence¡± in China market, but we need your real supports, which came from your real heart, I mean the genuine support. Support us to establish the Formlabs brand in China, at the appropriate stage of time, when you start to penetrate vertical fine-grain market, we hope you will lead the entire work and invite more powerful companies to share the market cake which has grown well.
		The future together with the Formlab brand after all is your own assets, but we believe, by our promotion with care and efforts, we will be your most trustworthy partner.

2.	Problem about how to support Elite Robotic in China market.
I thought this question was a little bit early to discuss and difficult to solve last year, since many of your business function and system was gradually accomplished, and meanwhile it took time for you to get well known about us. At present, I believe it is the time at which I can propose issues which is upsetting us, because only if we solved this problem, could we get the achievements which we want each other to realize: first of all, I thought in the past year, you paid in sufficient attention on China mainland market. Second
